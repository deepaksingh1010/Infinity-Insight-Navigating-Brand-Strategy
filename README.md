# Infinity-Insight-Navigating-Brand-Strategy

## Business Objective
The objective is to leverage Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Principal Components Regression (PCR) to understand the competitive landscape of car brands. The insights derived will help Infinity's managers make data-driven decisions to enhance product design, differentiate the brand in the market, and increase consumer preference.

Approach
## 1. Brand Mapping
Using Cars_Data.xlsx, develop brand maps to visualize Infinity's position relative to competitors and highlight areas for improvement.

## 2. Factor Analysis
From the Scree plot analysis, retain four key factors that best represent the brand landscape:

Z1 - Luxury: Focuses on brand attributes like attractiveness, quietness, prestige, and success.
Z2 - Maintenance: Emphasizes attributes related to unreliability and difficulty of service.
Z3 - Value for Money: Combines economy, perceived value, and interest.
Z4 - Unorthodox: Encompasses avant-garde and uncommon attributes.
## 3. Iso-Preference Line and Regression Line
The iso-preference line identifies combinations of features that customers value equally, guiding product feature prioritization.
The regression line models relationships among product features, aiding in prediction and analysis of consumer preferences.
## 4. Ideal Vector
The ideal vector points to the most preferred combinations of product features, guiding Infinity's product design strategies.

## 5. Angle Calculation
Determine the angles for strategic insights:

Z1 vs Z2: Iso-preference angle: -67.52°, Ideal vector angle: 22.47°
Z1 vs Z3: Iso-preference angle: -56.20°, Ideal vector angle: 33.79°
Z1 vs Z4: Iso-preference angle: -31.71°, Ideal vector angle: 58.28°
## 6. Confidence Interval for Ideal Vector Angle
Use data bootstrap methods to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the ideal vector angle, ensuring statistical accuracy in interpreting the results.

## 7. Strategic Recommendations
Based on the analysis:

Differentiation from BMW: To distinguish Infinity in the Maintenance vs. Luxury category, consider enhancing luxury features (e.g., prestige, attractiveness) or improving maintenance ratings.
Value for Money Enhancement: Adjust product features related to servicing difficulty to differentiate Infinity from Mercury in the Maintenance vs. Value for Money category.
These recommendations will empower Infinity's management to align product design with market demands and outshine competitors.
